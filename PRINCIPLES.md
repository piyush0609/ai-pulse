# AI Pulse — Guiding Principles

## Core Mission
Make users **better at working with AI** — not just informed about AI.

## Content Priorities (in order)

### 1. Effective LLM Workflows
- Prompting techniques
- Chaining and agent patterns
- Reducing iterations and hallucinations
- Structured outputs
- RAG setups

### 2. Safe LLM Usage
- Privacy — not leaking sensitive data
- Local vs cloud tradeoffs
- Hallucination detection and verification
- Guardrails and output validation
- Prompt injection defense
- Cost control and efficient prompting

### 3. Practical Tools
- Tools that improve workflows (not just "new tool launched")
- Developer-focused: cursor, aider, continue, etc.
- Integration tools, APIs, libraries

### 4. Open Source
- Repos with real utility, not just demos
- Local/private LLM options (ollama, llama.cpp)
- Community projects worth watching

### 5. Tutorials & Learning
- "How I built X with AI" posts
- Real workflows people share
- Practical guides, not theory

## Content Standards
- **Actionable over informational** — if you can't do something with it, skip it
- **Practitioner-level** — for people building with AI, not reading about AI
- **Quality over volume** — better to show 5 great items than 50 mediocre ones
- **De-prioritize corporate fluff** — press releases and announcements are noise
